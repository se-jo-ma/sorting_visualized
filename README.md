# sorting_visualized

This repository includes sorting.py which holds sorting algorithms that have been adapted to generate step by step visualizations and main.py which is used to create these visualizations. It also includes individual mp4s created for each of the sorting algorithms.

Right now you need to manually change which sorting algorithm you want displayed. This may be adjusted in the future but for now please be aware that you will need to change the title and the actual function used to create the generator variable.

Known issues include the fact that when you run main.py with the animation save it won't show the visualization. Make sure "anim.save(file_name, writer=writer)" is commented out if you want to view the animation.
